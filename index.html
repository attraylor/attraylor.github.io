<h2>Bio</h2>

I was a PhD student at <a href="https://cs.brown.edu"> Brown University</a>. I worked with Professor <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/people/epavlick/index.html">Ellie Pavlick</a> in the LUNAR (Language UNderstanding And Representation) Lab, and I was also advised by Professor <a href="https://www.brown.edu/academics/cognitive-linguistic-psychological-sciences/people/faculty/roman-feiman"> Roman Feiman</a> of the <a href="https://sites.brown.edu/bltlab/"> Brown Language and Thought Lab</a>. 
<br><br>
I studied the reasoning capabilities of language models. Mostly pretty small ones. And a lot more about developmental psychology than I thought I would going in!!
<br><br>
I am now a data scientist.
<br><br>
In May 2022 and May 2023, I was a summer intern for <a href="https://turing.microsoft.com">Microsoft Turing</a>.
<br><br>
In the summer of 2019, I worked as an intern at <a href="https://megagon.ai">Megagon Labs</a>.
<br><br>

Previously, I worked in <a href="https://people.cs.umass.edu/~mccallum/"> Professor Andrew McCallum</a>'s <a href="http://www.iesl.cs.umass.edu/"> Information Extraction and Synthesis Laboratory</a> and collaborated with <a href="https://people.cs.umass.edu/~nmonath">Nicholas Monath</a> and <a href="http://rajarshd.github.io/"> Rajarshi Das</a>.

<h2> Research Interests (Now)</h2>
If you've found this page, you likely are interested in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_8bWmku608">competitive Pokémon</a>. This game is unique among strategy games for many reasons, as it combines all of long-term planning, simultaneous action selection/imperfect information, and probability management, but it is mainly unique because of its emphasis on the "teambuilding" phase, called "deckbuilding" or "draft phase" in other games: both players select their action space within the game, and afterwards make actions in the environment. The draft phase is common in other games that AI systems have successfully played (Stratego, League of Legends, DotA 2, Honor of Kings), but in Pokémon, the draft phase is scaled up to an astronomically large state space (roughly 10^200), meaning the game will require novel research before formalizing it as a problem that can be solved with computer science, let alone before creating a system with superhuman strength. And what does it really mean to be superhuman, anyway? I can't tell you that I have an answer to that.
<br><br>
My research interests lie mostly at the intersection of competitive Pokémon alongside computer science and cognitive science, but also with regards to economics (i.e. behavioral game theory), mental health, neuroscience, or really anything you can think of. It's unbelievable how much you don't know about the game you've been playing all your life.
<br><br>
If you are curious or have more questions, please feel free to reach out to the email at the top of this page. Unfortunately, I can't commit to responses or collaborations at this time– I barely have enough time to play competitive Pokémon, let alone work on research ^_^' But I'm rooting for you, and I hope you find out more about the beauty of this game.

<h2> Research Interests (Back then)</h2>
My research was focused around how humans, langauge models, and other machine learning systems use <b>logic</b>. Logical reasoning is fundamental to human cognition, and humans apply it flexibly in a wide variety of contexts. How would a model have to behave for us to say that it has a similar capacity for logical reasoning or inference, especially if it does not explicitly represent logic symbolically? And, what is the fundamental source of logic in the human brain— are logical capabilities learned or innate? I approach these questions from a computational perspective, a philosophical perspective, and from a human developmental perspective.
<br><br>
I am interested in natural language understanding (NLU), computational cognitive science, neuro-symbolic frameworks, textual inference, reinforcement learning, and representation learning.
