<h2>Bio</h2>

I am a fourth year PhD student studying computer science at <a href="https://cs.brown.edu"> Brown University</a>. I am working with Professor <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/people/epavlick/index.html">Ellie Pavlick</a> in the LUNAR (Language UNderstanding And Representation) Lab, and I am also advised by Professor <a href="https://www.brown.edu/academics/cognitive-linguistic-psychological-sciences/people/faculty/roman-feiman"> Roman Feiman</a> of the <a href="https://sites.brown.edu/bltlab/"> Brown Language and Thought Lab</a>.
<br><br>
In the summer of 2019, I worked as an intern at <a href="https://megagon.ai">Megagon Labs</a>.
<br><br>

Previously, I worked in <a href="https://people.cs.umass.edu/~mccallum/"> Professor Andrew McCallum</a>'s <a href="http://www.iesl.cs.umass.edu/"> Information Extraction and Synthesis Laboratory</a> and collaborated with <a href="https://people.cs.umass.edu/~nmonath">Nicholas Monath</a> and <a href="http://rajarshd.github.io/"> Rajarshi Das</a>.
<br><br>

<h2> Research Interests </h2>
My research is focused around how both humans and modern machine learning models use <b>logic</b>. Logical reasoning is fundamental to human cognition, and humans apply it flexibly in a wide variety of contexts. How would a model have to behave for us to say that it has a similar capacity for logical reasoning or inference, especially if it does not explicitly represent logic symbolically? And, what is the fundamental source of logic in the human brain— are logical capabilities learned or innate? I approach these questions from a computational perspective, a philosophical perspective, and from a human developmental perspective.
<br><br>
I am interested in natural language understanding (NLU), computational cognitive science, neuro-symbolic frameworks, textual inference, reinforcement learning, and representation learning.
<br><br>
As a pet project, I am intersested in research involving <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_8bWmku608">competitive Pokémon</a>. This game is unique among zero-sum strategy games for several reasons, but mainly because of its emphasis on the "draft" phase: both players select their action space within the game, and afterwards make actions in the environment. The draft phase is common in other games that AI systems have successfully played (League of Legends, DotA 2, Honor of Kings), but in Pokémon, the draft phase is scaled up to an astronomically large state space (roughly 10^200).
